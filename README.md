## 1. Background & Context
Africa faces a profound energy crisis that fundamentally constraints economic
development and limits opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises
(SMEs). As of 2025, approximately 600 million Africans, representing 43% of the
continent's population and over 80% of the global population without electricity, lack
access to reliable power. This energy deficit is not merely about households in
darkness; it represents businesses that cannot operate, goods that cannot be
produced, and economies that cannot grow.
Energy sits at the center of economic and social development, yet access to reliable
and affordable power remains uneven across many emerging economies. In a region
where national electricity grids struggle with inefficiency, limited coverage, and
frequent outages, households and small businesses are often forced to rely on costly
and environmentally harmful alternatives.
This persistent gap has created a growing market opportunity for startups and
small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs) to deliver decentralized and renewable energy
solutions. These market players are increasingly positioning themselves as agile
problem-solvers—introducing solar-powered systems, clean energy financing
models, and energy-as-a-service solutions tailored to underserved communities.
Rather than replacing national utilities, these innovators complement existing
systems by addressing energy access where traditional infrastructure falls short.


## SDG Alignment & Impact
Assigned SDG
#### SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy
#### Goal: Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all
**Relationship Between the Problem and SDG 7**
The challenge of unreliable, expensive, and inefficient energy access faced by micro
and small enterprises (SMEs), especially refrigeration-dependent food retail
businesses, including butcheries and meat shops, small grocers with cold storage,
Mini-supermarkets, and cold chain distribution points across Sub-Saharan Africa, is
directly linked to the core objectives of SDG 7. 
Despite the region’s strong solar potential, many SMEs remain dependent on
unstable grid electricity and costly diesel generators, often spending 20–40% of their
revenue on energy.
A key but often overlooked barrier to clean energy adoption is information access.
SMEs lack affordable, independent, and technically reliable tools to assess whether
solar energy is financially viable for their specific business location and energy
needs. 
High costs and long timelines of traditional feasibility studies, combined with biased
installer quotes, prevent informed decision-making. This information gap limits
access to affordable energy, slows renewable energy adoption, and perpetuates
inefficient and polluting energy use—directly undermining progress toward SDG 7
targets.

**Contribution of the Proposed Solution to SDG 7**
The proposed solution addresses this gap by providing affordable, fast, and
independent solar viability assessments tailored specifically to SMEs. By leveraging
data-driven tools such as solar irradiance modeling and accurate
return-on-investment (ROI) projections, the solution enables businesses to
determine—before committing capital—whether solar energy is viable for them.
This contributes to SDG 7 by:
● Improving access to affordable energy through informed solar adoption
(Target 7.1)
● Increasing the share of renewable energy in SME energy consumption
(Target 7.2)
● Enhancing energy efficiency by enabling right-sized, optimized solar
systems and reducing energy waste (Target 7.3)
● Promoting clean energy investment and infrastructure by lowering entry
barriers for SMEs (Targets 7.a and 7.b)
Rather than installing solar systems directly, the solution unlocks adoption by
removing the decision-making and affordability barrier that prevents SMEs from
transitioning to clean energy.
