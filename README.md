## 1. Background & Context
Africa faces a profound energy crisis that fundamentally constraints economic
development and limits opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises
(SMEs). As of 2025, approximately 600 million Africans, representing 43% of the
continent's population and over 80% of the global population without electricity, lack
access to reliable power. This energy deficit is not merely about households in
darkness; it represents businesses that cannot operate, goods that cannot be
produced, and economies that cannot grow.
Energy sits at the center of economic and social development, yet access to reliable
and affordable power remains uneven across many emerging economies. In a region
where national electricity grids struggle with inefficiency, limited coverage, and
frequent outages, households and small businesses are often forced to rely on costly
and environmentally harmful alternatives.
This persistent gap has created a growing market opportunity for startups and
small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs) to deliver decentralized and renewable energy
solutions. These market players are increasingly positioning themselves as agile
problem-solvers—introducing solar-powered systems, clean energy financing
models, and energy-as-a-service solutions tailored to underserved communities.
Rather than replacing national utilities, these innovators complement existing
systems by addressing energy access where traditional infrastructure falls short.
