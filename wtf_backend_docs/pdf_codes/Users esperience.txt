WHAT USERS EXPERIENCE:
Amina's experience:
Gets report: Sees normal PDF with barely noticeable watermark

Downloads: Can download up to 10 times per hour (plenty!)

Returns later: Report still available if within 24 hours

Returns after 24h: Report automatically deleted (can regenerate)



Hacker's experience:
Tries to guess report IDs: Format validation blocks invalid IDs

Tries mass downloads: Rate limiting blocks after 10 attempts

Steals report: Watermark shows it belongs to specific business

Waits to attack: Cleanup removes old reports regularly

System benefits:
✅ Storage efficient (auto-deletes old reports)

✅ Traceable (watermarks identify source)

✅ Controlled access (rate limits prevent abuse)

✅ Secure (proper permissions prevent unauthorized access)
